## üîπ 1. What is a _Tree Data Structure_?

### Answer

A **tree data structure** is a hierarchical collection of nodes, typically visualized with a root at the top. Trees are typically used for representing relationships, hierarchies, and facilitating efficient data operations.

### Core Definitions

- **Node**: The basic unit of a tree that contains data and may link to child nodes.
- **Root**: The tree's topmost node; no nodes point to the root.
- **Parent / Child**: Nodes with a direct connection; a parent points to its children.
- **Leaf**: A node that has no children.
- **Edge**: A link or reference from one node to another.
- **Depth**: The level of a node, or its distance from the root.
- **Height**: Maximum depth of any node in the tree.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Hierarchical**: Organized in parent-child relationships.
2. **Non-Sequential**: Non-linear data storage ensures flexible and efficient access patterns.
3. **Directed**: Nodes are connected unidirectionally.
4. **Acyclic**: Trees do not have loops or cycles.
5. **Diverse Node Roles**: Such as root and leaf.

### Visual Representation

### Common Tree Variants

- **Binary Tree**: Each node has a maximum of two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where each node's left subtree has values less than the node and the right subtree has values greater.
- **AVL Tree**: A BST that self-balances to optimize searches.
- **B-Tree**: Commonly used in databases to enable efficient access.
- **Red-Black Tree**: A BST that maintains balance using node coloring.
- **Trie**: Specifically designed for efficient string operations.

### Practical Applications

- **File Systems**: Model directories and files.
- **AI and Decision Making**: Decision trees help in evaluating possible actions.
- **Database Systems**: Many databases use trees to index data efficiently.

### Tree Traversals

#### Depth-First Search

- **Preorder**: Root, Left, Right.
- **Inorder**: Left, Root, Right (specific to binary trees).
- **Postorder**: Left, Right, Root.

#### Breadth-First Search

- **Level Order**: Traverse nodes by depth, moving from left to right.

### Code Example: Binary Tree

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.data = data

# Create a tree structure
root = Node(1)
root.left, root.right = Node(2), Node(3)
root.left.left, root.right.right = Node(4), Node(5)

# Inorder traversal
def inorder_traversal(node):
    if node:
        inorder_traversal(node.left)
        print(node.data, end=' ')
        inorder_traversal(node.right)

# Expected Output: 4 2 1 3 5
print("Inorder Traversal: ")
inorder_traversal(root)
```

---

## üîπ 2. What is a _Binary Tree_?

### Answer

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children, termed as **left child** and **right child**. Each node holds a data element and pointers to its left and right children.

### Binary Tree Types

- **Full Binary Tree**: Nodes either have two children or none.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, with nodes skewed to the left.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children, and leaves exist on the same level.

### Visual Representation

![Binary Tree Types](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/binary%20tree%2Ftree-types.png?alt=media&token=847de252-5545-4a29-9e28-7a7e93c8e657)

### Applications

- **Binary Search Trees**: Efficient in lookup, addition, and removal operations.
- **Expression Trees**: Evaluate mathematical expressions.
- **Heap**: Backbone of priority queues.
- **Trie**: Optimized for string searches.

### Code Example: Binary Tree & In-order Traversal

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    """Binary tree node with left and right child."""
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.data = data

    def insert(self, data):
        """Inserts a node into the tree."""
        if data < self.data:
            if self.left is None:
                self.left = Node(data)
            else:
                self.left.insert(data)
        elif data > self.data:
            if self.right is None:
                self.right = Node(data)
            else:
                self.right.insert(data)

    def in_order_traversal(self):
        """Performs in-order traversal and returns a list of nodes."""
        nodes = []
        if self.left:
            nodes += self.left.in_order_traversal()
        nodes.append(self.data)
        if self.right:
            nodes += self.right.in_order_traversal()
        return nodes


# Example usage:
# 1. Instantiate the root of the tree
root = Node(50)

# 2. Insert nodes (This will implicitly form a Binary Search Tree for simplicity)
values_to_insert = [30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]
for val in values_to_insert:
    root.insert(val)

# 3. Perform in-order traversal
print(root.in_order_traversal())  # Expected Output: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
```

## üîπ 3. What is _Binary Heap_?

### Answer

A **Binary Heap** is a special binary tree that satisfies the **Heap Property**: parent nodes are ordered relative to their children.

There are two types of binary heaps:

- **Min Heap**: Parent nodes are less than or equal to their children.
- **Max Heap**: Parent nodes are greater than or equal to their children.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Shape Property**: A binary heap is a complete binary tree, which means all its levels are filled except the last one, which is filled from the left.
2. **Heap Property**: Nodes follow a specific order‚Äîeither min heap or max heap‚Äîrelative to their children.

### Visual Representation

![Min Heap and Max Heap Example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/binary%20tree%2Fmax-heap-min-heap%20(1).png?alt=media&token=3c2136ee-ada1-41c9-9ddb-590e4338f585)

### Array-Based Representation

Due to the **complete binary tree structure**, binary heaps are often implemented as **arrays**, offering both spatial efficiency and cache-friendly access patterns.

- **Root Element**: Stored at index 0.
- **Child-Parent Mapping**:
  - Left child: `(2*i) + 1`
  - Right child: `(2*i) + 2`
  - Parent: `(i-1) / 2`

#### Example Array

```plaintext
Index:     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Elements: 1 3 2 6 5 7 8 9 10 0 4
```

#### Advantages

- **Memory Efficiency**: No extra pointers needed.
- **Cache Locality**: Adjacent elements are stored closely, aiding cache efficiency.

#### Limitations

- **Array Sizing**: The array size must be predefined.
- **Percolation**: Insertions and deletions may require element swapping, adding computational overhead.

### Code Example: Array-based Binary Heap Operations

Here is the Python code:

```python
class BinaryHeap:
    def __init__(self, array):
        self.heap = array

    def get_parent_index(self, index):
        return (index - 1) // 2

    def get_left_child_index(self, index):
        return (2 * index) + 1

    def get_right_child_index(self, index):
        return (2 * index) + 2

# Example usage
heap = BinaryHeap([1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 4])
parent_index = heap.get_parent_index(4)
left_child_index = heap.get_left_child_index(1)
print(f"Parent index of node at index 4: {parent_index}")
print(f"Left child index of node at index 1: {left_child_index}")
```

## üîπ 4. What is a _Binary Search Tree_?

### Answer

A **Binary Search Tree** (BST) is a binary tree optimized for quick lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. A BST has the distinct property that each node's left subtree contains values smaller than the node, and its right subtree contains values larger.

### Key Characteristics

- **Sorted Elements**: Enables efficient searching and range queries.
- **Recursive Definition**: Each node and its subtrees also form a BST.
- **Unique Elements**: Generally, BSTs do not allow duplicates, although variations exist.

### Visual Representation

![Binary Tree vs BST](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/binary%20tree%2Fvalid-binary-search-tree-example.png?alt=media&token=5821a405-7991-4c92-976b-b187a5a25fe3)

### Formal Properties

For any node $N$ in the BST:

$$
$$
\forall L \in \text{Left-Subtree}(N) & : \text{Value}(L) < \text{Value}(N) \\
\forall R \in \text{Right-Subtree}(N) & : \text{Value}(R) > \text{Value}(N)
$$
$$

### Practical Applications

- **Databases**: Used for efficient indexing.
-  **File Systems**: Employed in OS for file indexing.
- **Text Editors**: Powers auto-completion and suggestions.

### Time Complexity

- **Search**: $O(\log n)$ in balanced trees; $O(n)$ in skewed trees.
- **Insertion**: Averages $O(\log n)$; worst case is $O(n)$.
- **Deletion**: Averages $O(\log n)$; worst case is $O(n)$.

### Code Example: Validating a BST

Here is the Python code:

```python
def is_bst(node, min=float('-inf'), max=float('inf')):
    if node is None:
        return True
    if not min < node.value < max:
        return False
    return (is_bst(node.left, min, node.value) and
            is_bst(node.right, node.value, max))
```

## üîπ 5. What are advantages and disadvantages of _BST_?

### Answer

The **Binary Search Tree** (BST) is a versatile data structure that offers many benefits but also comes with limitations.

### Advantages of Using BSTs

1. **Quick Search Operations**: A balanced BST can perform search operations in $O(\log n)$ time, making it much faster than linear structures like arrays and linked lists.

2. **Dynamic Allocation**: Unlike arrays that require pre-defined sizes, BSTs are dynamic in nature, adapting to data as it comes in. This results in better space utilization.

3. **Space Efficiency**: With $O(n)$ space requirements, BSTs are often more memory-efficient than other structures like hash tables, especially in memory-sensitive applications.

4. **Versatile Operations**: Beyond simple insertions and deletions, BSTs excel in:
    - Range queries
    - Nearest smaller or larger element searches
    - Different types of tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

5. **Inherent Sorting**: BSTs naturally keep their elements sorted, making them ideal for tasks that require efficient and frequent sorting.

6. **Predictable Efficiency**: Unlike hash tables, which can have unpredictable worst-case scenarios, a balanced BST maintains consistent $O(\log n)$ performance.

7. **Practical Utility**: BSTs find applications in:
    - Database indexing for quick data retrieval
    - Efficient file searching in operating systems
    - Task scheduling based on priorities

### Disadvantages of Using BSTs

1. **Limited Direct Access**: While operations like `insert`, `delete`, and `lookup` are efficient, direct access to elements by index can be slow, taking $O(n)$ time in unbalanced trees.

2. **Risk of Imbalance**: If not managed carefully, a BST can become unbalanced, resembling a linked list and losing its efficiency advantages.

3. **Memory Costs**: Each node in a BST requires additional memory for two child pointers, which could be a concern in memory-constrained environments.

4. **Complex Self-Balancing Algorithms**: While self-balancing trees like AVL or Red-Black trees mitigate the risk of imbalance, they are more complex to implement.

5. **Lack of Global Optimum**: BSTs do not readily provide access to the smallest or largest element, unlike data structures like heaps.

## üîπ 6. Explain the difference between _Binary Tree_ and _Binary Search Tree_.

### Answer

While **Binary Trees** and **Binary Search Trees** (BSTs) share a tree-like structure, they are differentiated by key features such as node ordering and operational efficiency.

### Key Distinctions

#### Node Ordering

   - **Binary Tree**: No specific ordering rules between parent and child nodes.
   - **BST**: Nodes are ordered‚Äîleft children are smaller, and right children are larger than the parent node.

#### Efficiency in Searching

   - **Binary Tree**: $O(n)$ time complexity due to the need for full traversal in the worst case.
   - **BST**: Improved efficiency with $O(\log n)$ time complexity in balanced trees.

#### Node Insertion and Deletion

   - **Binary Tree**: Flexible insertion without constraints.
   - **BST**: Ordered insertion and deletion to maintain the tree's structure.

#### Tree Balancing

   - **Binary Tree**: Generally, balancing is not required.
   - **BST**: Balancing is crucial for optimized performance.

#### Use Cases

   - **Binary Tree**: Often used in heaps, tries, and tree traversal algorithms.
   - **BST**: Commonly used in dynamic data handling scenarios like maps or sets in standard libraries.

### Visual Comparison

#### Binary Tree

In this **Binary Tree**, there's no specific ordering. For instance, 6 is greater than its parent node, 1, but is on the left subtree.

```plaintext
    5
   / \
  1   8
 / \
6   3
```

#### Binary Search Tree

Here, the **Binary Search Tree** maintains the ordering constraint. All nodes in the left subtree (3, 1) are less than 5, and all nodes in the right subtree (8) are greater than 5.

```plaintext
    5
   / \
  3   8
 / \
1   4
```

### Key Takeaways

- **BSTs** offer enhanced efficiency in lookups and insertions.
- **Binary Trees** provide more flexibility but can be less efficient in searches.
- Both trees are comparable in terms of memory usage.

---

## üîπ 7. Compare _Trie_ vs. _Binary Search Trie_.

### Answer

While **Tries** are specialized for tasks involving strings and are especially efficient for datasets with shared prefixes, **BSTs** are versatile, general-purpose trees that can store any ordered data.

### Time Complexity

#### Look-up

- **Trie**: This is determined by the length of the word/key being looked up. Hence, the time complexity is $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of the key.
- **BST**: Efficient look-ups in balanced BSTs are $O(\log n)$, but if the BST becomes skewed, it degrades to $O(n)$.

#### Insertion and Deletion

- **Trie**: Insertion and deletion are typically $O(m)$, with $m$ being the key's length.
- **BST**: Insertion and deletion are $O(\log n)$ in a balanced tree. However, in the worst-case scenario (unbalanced tree), these operations can take $O(n)$ time.

### Space Complexity

- **Trie**: Often more space-efficient, especially when dealing with datasets having short keys with common prefixes. It can save considerable space by sharing common prefix nodes.
- **BST**: Every node in the BST requires storage for its key and pointers to its two children. This fixed overhead can make BSTs less space-efficient than tries, especially for large datasets.

### Specialized Operations

- **Trie**: Excels at operations like longest-prefix matching, making it an ideal choice for applications such as autocompletion, IP routing, and more.
- **BST**: While not specialized like tries, BSTs are more general-purpose and can handle a wider range of tasks.

### Maintenance and Balance

- **Trie**: Inherently balanced, making them relatively low-maintenance. This ensures consistent performance without the need for additional balancing algorithms.
- **BST**: To maintain efficient operation, BSTs often require balancing using specific algorithms or tree structures like AVL or Red-Black trees. Without periodic balancing, the tree could become skewed, leading to suboptimal performance.
